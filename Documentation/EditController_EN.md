# Controller EditController
It is a **universal controller** for views that want to display the complete data of a record
of data of a model, in format "tab" or by a design of columns grouped according to the type of information.
The use of this controller greatly simplifies the programming required for editing the data,
as well as unify the image of the application and plugins creating a uniform environment for the user which speeds up learning
and adaptation to **Facturascripts**.

For the use of this controller it is necessary to create the views in XML format, as described in the
document [XMLViews] (https://github.com/ArtexTrading/facturascripts/blob/master/Documentation/XMLViews_EN.md), included in the documentation
of **Facturascripts**.

## Using the Controller
To use _EditController_ we must create a new PHP class that inherits or extends from EditController, establishing in the constructor
of our new class the model on which we will work and having to implement the following method:

* **getPageData**: Sets the general data (title, icon, menu, etc) for the view

```PHP
    public function __construct(&$cache, &$i18n, &$miniLog, $className)
    {
        parent::__construct($cache, $i18n, $miniLog, $className);

        // Establecemos el modelo de datos
        $this->modelName = 'FacturaScripts\Core\Model\Familia';
    }
```

Indicate that the name of the XML view to be loaded will be the same as the new class we created.
There are also general methods that we can override to customize the screen, (see below).

### getPageData
This method is responsible for returning an array with the data for the installation and configuration of the controller
within the environment of **Facturascripts**. As a rule, you must call the _parent_ of the controller to initialize the
default values and ensure a proper operation of our controller in the Facturascripts environment.

The values that can be configured are:
* **title**: Translation reference for view title
* **icon**: Text font icon _fontawesome_
* **menu**: Name of the menu where the controller will be inserted
* **submenu**: (optional) Second level of the menu where the controller would be entered
* **order**: We can alter the natural order of the menu system to place our controller higher or lower

```PHP
    public function getPageData()
    {
        $pagedata = parent::getPageData();
        $pagedata['title'] = 'agents';
        $pagedata['icon'] = 'fa-user-circle-o';
        $pagedata['menu'] = 'admin';
        return $pagedata;
    }
```

## Customization
There are two methods that allow us to customize the data to be displayed in the header and footer of the data sheet.

```PHP
    public function getPanelHeader()
    {
        return $this->i18n->trans('header-data');
    }

    public function getPanelFooter()
    {
        return $this->i18n->trans('footer-data');
    }
```

We can also customize the view by including it in the group XML file
_\<rows\>_ and create _\<row type = ""\>_ of the classes **header**, to define a list of
statistical and relational buttons with other models, and **footer**, to add information
additional to display to the user just after the data sheet.

Examples:

```XML
    <rows>
        <row type="header">
            <option icon="fa-files-o" label="Alb. Pdtes:" calculateby="nombre_function" onclick="#url"></option>
            <option icon="fa-files-o" label="Pdte Cobro:" calculateby="nombre_function" onclick="#url"></option>
        </row>        

        <row type="footer">
            <option label="Panel Footer" footer="Panel footer" color="warning">This is an example with header and footer</option>
            <option label="Esto es un info" color="info">This is an example with header and without footer</option>
            <option footer="Texto en el footer" color="success">This is an example without header</option>
        </row>  
    </rows>
```
